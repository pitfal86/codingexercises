class = blueprint (house)
reference = address to object
    House house = new House ();
    House newHouse = house;

    above both reference the same object
instance = object created (new keyword)



static or instance method?
1. does it use any fields (instance variables) or instance method?
    yes = instance method
    no = static method

static variables
1. once changed, all other instances of that object will receive it (both old and new)
    ** Scanner is good instance of this.... since all user input should change all objects **
    private static String name;

    Dog rex = new (Dog("rex");
    Dog fluffy = new Dog ("fluffy");
    both above will have name as "fluffy" since fluffy was last set
